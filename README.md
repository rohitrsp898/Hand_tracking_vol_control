# Hand_tracking_vol_control
Using hand detection to control the system volume.

In this we are using Mediapipe <https://mediapipe.dev/> Hand Landmark Model for hand tracking.
We will use first finger and thumb gesture to change the system volume.
To change system volume we are using pycaw module <https://github.com/AndreMiras/pycaw> It will make work easy.

So in this we first make a Hand tracking model and then we use that model in our code to change the System volume.
